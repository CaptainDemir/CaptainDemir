### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# I'm Demir. 

## An interesting fact about me is that before I got into Devops Engineering, I used to be a ship officer. I spent a lot of time on the sea, working with my crew to manage and maintain the ship, solving problems each day. I'd like to think that there are some philosophical similarities between the responsibilities of a sailor and a devops engineer. If you ask me, I'd say ship management in theory is a lot of like code deployment.

## Today, I am a devops engineer and I am passionate about my career as I truly enjoy this work. I am always looking to grow my skills and I look forward to growing with an organization one day.
